## Overview
This research project explores the implementation of advanced AI techniques and synthetic data generation for improving pavement management systems (PMS) in California. The project focuses on utilizing OpenUSD and machine learning to enhance road condition monitoring, maintenance prediction, and infrastructure management.

## üéØ Key Objectives
- Develop synthetic data generation pipelines for road condition simulation
- Integrate real-world and synthetic data for ML model training
- Improve pavement wear prediction accuracy
- Create more efficient maintenance scheduling systems

## üõ† Technologies & Tools
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** OpenUSD
- **Data Collection:** LiDAR, Drone Mapping (Mavic 3E), GPS Systems (Topcon Hiper V)
- **Machine Learning:** Path Generation, Computer Vision
- **Hardware:** Profilometer Systems, Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS)
- **Data Processing:** Python, C++

## üìä Implementation Details

### 1. Data Collection System
Current implementation utilizes multiple data sources:
- High-precision laser scanning (¬±0.1mm accuracy)
- Drone-based aerial imagery
- LiDAR point clouds
- GPS mapping data
- Inertial profiler measurements

### 2. Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline
```python
# Example OpenUSD setup for road condition simulation
from pxr import Usd, UsdGeom, Sdf

# Create stage and define road surface
stage = Usd.Stage.CreateNew("road_condition.usda")
xformPrim = UsdGeom.Xform.Define(stage, "/Road")
roadPrim = UsdGeom.Mesh.Define(stage, "/Road/Surface")

# Define material and wear patterns
material = UsdShade.Material.Define(stage, "/Road/Surface/Material")
# Add various wear patterns and defects
```

### 3. Model Training Architecture
The system combines:
- Real-world data from California's road network
- Synthetically generated edge cases
- Historical wear patterns
- Environmental factors
